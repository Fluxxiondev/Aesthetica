## Authentication (Supabase)

This project includes a basic Supabase Auth integration (email/password). To enable it:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
2. Install new dependencies: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
3. Run the app with `npm start`.

Files added/changed for auth: `lib/supabaseClient.ts`, `store/*`, `app/(auth)/*`, `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`.

Notes: The Supabase client reads values from environment variables. In Expo you can use `app.config.js` or `expo-cli` env injection for local testing.
